![FM-DX Webserver  Tuner localhost  - localhost](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aed4f5cc-1099-4aaf-8033-ae123ea49652)


A simple widget for displaying radio propagation maps, designed to be responsive for both desktop and mobile devices. The widget allows users to select different propagation map versions and saves their preferences for future visits using `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to mobile and desktop layouts automatically.
- **Selectable Propagation Maps**: Provides users with multiple options for radio propagation maps (5 options available).
- **User Preference Persistence**: Saves the user's selected map in `localStorage`, ensuring the same map is displayed upon their return to the page.
- **Toggle Visibility**: Users can toggle the widget's visibility by clicking the "Propagation" button.
- **Mobile-Friendly Dropdown**: On smaller screens, a dropdown is used instead of radio buttons for easier navigation.



## Installation:
1. Copy the **radio-propagation.js** file and the **radio-propagation** folder to your FM-DX Webserver's **plugins** folder
2. Restart your FM-DX Webserver
3. Enable the plugin in the administration panel
4. Enjoy!
